# Immigrants_and_Mainstream
Replication package to accompany research paper "From Strange to Normal: Computational Approaches to Examining Immigrant Incorporation through Shifts in the Mainstream" by Zachary D. Kline, Andrea Voyer, Madison Danton, and Tatiana Volkova.

The syntax included in this replication package can be used to replicate the analyses presented in the main paper,  and in the accompanying online appendices. Please find here a matching guide:

EP-IMP: Results from main analyses. Figures for the online appendix are created and exported from this file: see line 4332
___________________________________________________________________________________________

EP-IMG_128: Creates results using a less stringent cutoff of 1.28, appendix A

EP-IMG_233: Creates results using a more stringent cutoff of 2.33, appendix A

EP-IMG_fastTM: Creates results using fastTM embeddings, appendix C

EP-IMG_ngram20: Creates results using the 1920 Google N-Gram Embeddings, appendix C

EP-IMG_ngram40: Creates results using the 1940 Google N-Gram Embeddings, appendix C

EP-IMG_ngram60: Creates results using the 1960 Google N-Gram Embeddings, appendix C

EP-IMG_ngram80: Creates results using the 1980 Google N-Gram Embeddings, appendix C

EP-IMG_neutral: Creates results from neutral terms for appendix D

EP-IMG_centroid: Creates results from alternative immigrant specification, appendix E

EP-IMG_misc: A small sample of miscelanious syntax from preliminary analyses and previous robustness checks, not discussed in the paper
